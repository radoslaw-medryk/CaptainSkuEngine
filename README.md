# CaptainSkuEngine

This project is a simple promotion engine. It applies defined promotions to a basket of SKUs.

Example promotions could be like:

- 3 of A's for 130
- 2 of B's for 45
- C & D for 30

The engine will apply the promotions where needed, trying in an order defined (i.e. some promotions have priority over others).

### Technology

This project is written as a C# .NET Standard 2.1 library. It is created using Rider IDE on Mac. It doesn't use any external dependencies other than NUnit for Unit Testing.
